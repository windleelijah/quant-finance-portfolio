This project simulates a basic exchange-style limit book order with price-time priority matching. It supports market mechanics like bid.ask queues, trade execution, and order book visualization

## Features
- FIFO Matching Engine
- Buy/Sell Order Queues
- Trade Execution Logic
- Order book depth visualization

## How to Run
```bash
python simulator.py

## Future Improvement Ideas
- Unit tests for matching logic
- Dashboard for easier interaction
- Port core matching logic to C++
- Integration with real-time data

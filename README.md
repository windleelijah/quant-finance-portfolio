# quant-finance-portfolio
Welcome to my personal repository of projects intended to demonstrate my proficiency in Python and C++ for solving problems in quantitative finance. This collection spans algorithmic trading, finanical modeling, risk analysis, and data-driven strategies with each project crafted to reflect real-world application.

# Purpose
This repository serves as a portfolio of the work i've done to learn more about the world of quantitative finance, showcasing:
- Efficient use of Python for data analysis, prototyping and visualization
- High-performance C++ implementation for latency-sensitive tasks
- Integration of financial theory with practical coding solutions

# Technologies Used
Languages: Python 3.x, C++17/20

Libraries:
- Python: Numpy, pandas, matplotlib, yfinance
- C++: Boost, Eigen, Quantlib
Tools: Git, Jupyter

# Background
I've created these projects to deepen my understanding of financial engineering and computational finance. Many are inspired by the work I wish to pursue more of in the future or books I have read. These books include:
- Option Volatility and Pricing by Sheldon Natenberg
- The Mathematics of Finanical Derivatives by Paul Wilmott, Sam Howison and Jeff Dewynne
- Market Models: A Guide to Finanical Data Analysis by Carol Alexander
